## Hi ðŸ‘‹

This is my personal learning record for CIS198. Rust Programming of the university of Pennsylvania. Recently I want to learn a new programming language. After navigating through the many options, I learned that *Rust* has been the most popular language chosen by Stack Overflow for many years in a row. That's it!
