## Hi ðŸ‘‹

This is my learning record for CIS198. Rust Programming of the University of Pennsylvania. Recently I want to learn a new programming language. After navigating through the many options, I learned that *Rust* has been the most popular language chosen by Stack Overflow for many years in a row. That's it!

## Resources

## Hws

- [x] [Hw01. Rust Finger Exercises](./hw01)
- [x] [Hw02. A Mediocre Binary Search Tree](./hw02)
- [x] [Hw03. "Iterating" On Your Binary Search Tree](./hw03)
- [x] [Hw04. Reverse Polish ~~Sausage~~ Notation Calculator](./hw04)
- [x] [Hw05. The ~~Fun-Time Reference Sharing~~ Darkest Dungeon](./hw05)
- [x] [Hw06. BB-198 - A Bulletin Board System (BBS)](./hw06)
- [x] [Hw07. A Multithreaded Chat System](./hw07)

## Notes

The slides are concise and clear, which should give you a basic understanding of how rust works. The drawback is that it doesn't go into the details, so you may find yourself needing to refer to other learning resources to tackle the homework.

Also, parts of the course materials are outdated in 2022. e.g. `try!` macro is deprecated now.

In my opinion, **we should learn the rust using other resources - [The Rust Programming Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/), etc. Then we can do the homework to get some practiceðŸ˜„**
